# Scheme-ish interpreter and autodiff

This was just for fun and it's here for the record only. I'd initially
thought that having one's own SCIP-style scheme interpreter with lazy
evaluation would allow elegant autodiff. But in the end I realized
there's no need for lazy evaluation or other fanciness so we may as
well use Python.
